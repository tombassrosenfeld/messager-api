# Team Messenger API

This api is built using Laravel ([Laravel README below](#laravel-readme)) for the purpose of serving an API to be consumed by a React SPA. TODO: link repo

## Set up

Clone this repo - cd into the project directory and run `composer install`.

This project uses Homestead to run locally. If you don't have Vagrant set up, the docs are [here](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/homestead).

Update the .env DB_DATABASE to `homestead` and, if you don't have lots of RAM to spare, reduce the memory in the Homestead.yaml to 512.

Run vagrant up.

Run `php artisan db:seed`. This will create 10 users, 20 chats and 300 messages. Want more? Run it again.

## The Project

I started by drawing out a database diagram. This can be found [here](https://dbdiagram.io/d/6167180d940c4c4eec93ffeb). This provided me with the basis for my initial migrations.

A trello board can be found [here](https://trello.com/b/SkJIkD0U/team-messenger) with the setps I took (and some steps for stretch goals that I may or may not complete).

## Endpoints

The following will be necessary (question marks denote stretch/unnecessary for basic functionality)

setters:

- chat
- message
- user?
- add user to existing chat?

getters:

- user chats
- chat messages
- users
- user

delete:

- message?
- chat?

## To Do

- Expand test coverage
- Improve validation including enforcing a unique chat name. 
- Many other things!

I'd love to have implimented Pusher for push notifications and Passport for authorisation. I had to use a hack to add a password for each new user as I didn't want to remove the passwords from the schema. I plan to keep working on this project moving forward as I've really enjoyed it.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.
